Welcome, Web3 developer!

## What is Taquito?

Taquito is a fast and lightweight [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) library to accelerate DApp development on the [Tezos](https://tezos.com/developers) blockchain. With it, you can easily interact with Smart Contracts deployed to Tezos. It is distributed as a suite of individual `npm` packages, to reduce bloat and improve application startup times.

## What about Smart Contract Development?

If you are a current or aspiring "full-stack" blockchain developer, be sure to check out Taquito's sister project [Taqueria](https://taqueria.io). Taqueria is a Developer Tool Suite with *rich support* for Smart Contract development and orchestration on Tezos, and fully compliments Taquito.

## What is Included in Taquito?

Taquito is primarily targeted at Front-End Web3 developers, so it comes with batteries included, such as a [React Template Project](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taquito-react-template), an extensible framework, and many helpful utilities. It can be used in *many* execution contexts, including Serverless, Node.js, Deno, and Electron (to name a few) and has minimal dependencies.

## Who uses Taquito?

Taquito is used by **over 80% of DApps** in the Tezos ecosystem. It is easy to use, [proven secure](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/3204#security) and [tested continuously](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taquito/actions/workflows/main.yml) against current versions of Tezos (both Mainnet *and* Testnets).

## Why should I use Taquito?

Taquito provides convenient abstractions for a multitude of common operations, including wallet interactions (with [WalletConnect2](https://docs.walletconnect.com/2.0) in the works), batching operations, calling into contracts, querying the blockchain, and more. Taquito will isolate your code from subtle - and some not-so-subtle - changes made to the underlying Tezos protocol.

...Not to mention our thriving, helpful, and welcoming community!

## Project Organization

Taquito is organized as a [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo), and is composed of several npm packages that are [published to npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@taquito/taquito) under the `@taquito` handle. Each package has its own README which can be found in the corresponding directory within `packages/`.

## API Documentation

TypeDoc API documentation for Taquito [is available here](https://tezostaquito.io/typedoc).

## Versioning Strategy

Supported versions of Taquito packages are maintained for the *current* and *next* (beta) protocol versions.

Taquito uses [Semantic Versioning](TODO), (or, "SemVer") but with a small twist: the *Major* version number that we use tracks the latest version of Tezos (the *Minor* and *Patch* numbers do however follow SemVer norms).

For example, in a past release the protocol was at `004-...`, and `005-...` was being promoted through the *on-chain amendment process* (a feature unique to Tezos). So at that time, the current version for Taquito was `v4.0.0`, and work commenced on version `v5.0.0-beta.1`.

### Release Timing

When it becomes clear that the next protocol proposal will be promoted, AND we have implemented and tested interoperability with the new protocol, we release the next version (`v5.0.0-beta.1` in this example) BEFORE the chain transitions to the new protocol.

It is essential for updated packages to be released before the protocol changes, so that Taquito developers have time to update and test their projects.

During "Major" version updates, the Taquito public APIs MAY include breaking changes; we endeavor to make this clear, and document it in our release notes.

Note that all previous releases are *backwards compatible* with chain data, all the way back to the *genesis protocol*. Support for older Tezos node RPCs is maintained where feasible, but are eventually dropped.

We encourage you to update older versions of Taquito, and you are encouraged to contact us with any technical issues that preclude doing so.

## Releases

Releases are pushed to npmjs.org and the Github releases page. The maintainers sign all official releases.

Releases (git tags and npm packages) are signed either by [keybase/jevonearth][2] or [keybase/simrob][3]. Releases that are not signed, or signed by other keys, should be [brought to our attention](TODO) *immediately* please.

## Contributors Getting Started

You would like to make a contribution to Taquito? Wonderful! Please read on.

### Setup and build the Taquito project

*It is important to perform the following in the stated order*

* Install `libudev-dev`, if developing on GNU/Linux:

    `sudo apt-get install libudev-dev`

*This package contains low-level files required to compile against `libudev-*`.*

* Install/use a suitable version of **Node.js** (_as listed above_), for example:

    `nvm use lts/gallium`

* Install `lerna` **globally** (used by our blazingly-fast nx-based build system):

    `npm install --global lerna`

### Setup and build Taquito

Now that your prerequisites have been installed, run the following commands:
```sh
$ npm clean-install
...
$ npm run build
...
```

If all goes well, the last step is to run the unit tests, which should all pass:
```sh
$ npm run test
```

### Build GOTCHAS!

* **Do not delete `node_modules/` manually, as this will confuse the build system**

The taquito build system is based on `nx`, which uses caching extensively; please use `npm run clean` instead.

* **Do not use `npm install`, as it will unnecessarily update `package.json`**

The `npm clean-install` command (or just `npm ci`) produces a stable installation of all depenencies and respects `package-lock.json`. This will ensure a deterministic and repeatable build. It is also some 2x to 10x faster than `npm install`: hooray!

### Useful npm command targets/scripts

See the top-level `package.json` "scripts" section. Common targets include:

* `npm run clean`: Recursively delete all build artifacts
* `npm run test`: Run the unit tests
* `npm run build`: Generate bundles, typings, and create TypeDocs for all packages
* `npm run lint`: Run the code linter (`eslint`)
* `npm run example`: Run an example Node.js app that demonstrates all functionality

### Running Integration Tests

The Taquito integration tests are located in the `integration-tests/` directory. Please see the README.md in that directory for further information.

#### Modifying Taquito source

After making your changes to Taquito, lint and run the unit test suite; this will let you know if your changes are working well with the rest of the project:
```sh
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run commit
```

Please use `npm run commit` for your last commit before you push, as this will automagically formulate the correct commit format. A final lint and test cycle will take place before the commit is performed.

### Running the website locally

You may wish to contribute to the live code examples, this explains how to do that. Note that the Tezos Taquito [website][4] is built using [Docusaurus][5].

To run the Taquito website in development mode locally, run the following commands from top-level:

* Run `npm clean-install`
* Run `npm -w @taquito/website start`
