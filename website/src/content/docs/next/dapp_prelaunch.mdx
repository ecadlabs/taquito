Below are considerations for building your Tezos dapp or before publishing it. These pointers help prevent bugs and improve your users' experience.

## Infrastructure

### Use a reliable RPC node

Running your own RPC node is often the best choice, especially if you anticipate significant traffic. Using a paid hosted node is also a great option. See the [list of public Tezos nodes](./rpc_nodes).

### Specify fees and storage limits

Hard-coding fees and storage limits for smart contract calls has two advantages:
- Your dapp makes fewer calls to the RPC node, making it faster
- Fine-tuned gas and storage values reduce the likelihood of backtracked operations

## Performance

### Enable Local Pack

Local Pack reduces bigmap search time by 50%. Enable it by providing a `MichelCodecPacker` instance to the `setPackerProvider` method of `TezosToolkit`.

### Optimize HTTP requests

JavaScript frameworks provide lifecycle hooks for DOM updates (React `useEffect`, Vue `beforeUpdate`, Svelte `afterUpdate`). If these trigger calls to Tezos nodes or indexers, optimize them carefully. Unnecessary HTTP requests increase server traffic and slow down your dapp.

### Handle big numbers

Michelson uses arbitrary-precision numbers that can become very long. JavaScript switches to scientific notation for large numbers, which can confuse users. Use `bignumber.js` to handle potentially long numbers from the blockchain.

## Wallet Integration

### Test with popular wallets

Testing with Kukai and Temple wallets is essential. Testing with all wallets is recommended.

### Create a single BeaconWallet instance

Reuse one `BeaconWallet` instance throughout your dapp. JavaScript frameworks offer solutions to share data between components:
- React: Context API
- Vue: Pinia (Third-party)
- Svelte: Stores

Creating multiple `BeaconWallet` instances may cause errors when forging transactions.

## User Experience

### Confirm operations and check results

Wait for operation confirmation and check whether it succeeded or failed. This information is crucial for users to know if their transaction went through.

### Display user-friendly error messages

Inform users about skipped, backtracked, and failed transactions. A lack of visual feedback when transactions fail can be confusing.

### Enable error reporting

An error reporting tool like [BugSnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/platforms/javascript) helps you understand issues your users face.
