Operations must be _forged_ and _signed_ before they gets injected into the blockchain. _Forging_ is the act of encoding your operation into its binary representation. 

## Forger implementations 

Forging can be done either remotely using the RPC node or locally. Note that forging locally is considered a safer option. **If forging remotely, it is important to ensure that the node is trusted.** 

`LocalForger` is set by default on the `TezosToolkit`. The `LocalForger` is implemented in the `@taquito/local-forging` package, which provides developers with local forging and parsing functionalities.

## Changing the underlying forger

### Composite forger

Using a Composite forger can provide additional security because the binary returned by the forger instances will be compared and if there is a mismatch, a `ForgingMismatchError` will be thrown. Here is an example of a composite forger using the `LocalForger` and the `RpcForger`. 

```js
import { TezosToolkit, RpcForger, CompositeForger } from '@taquito/taquito';
import { localForger } from '@taquito/local-forging';

const Tezos = new TezosToolkit('https://YOUR_PREFERRED_RPC_URL');
const rpcForger = Tezos.getFactory(RpcForger)();
const composite = new CompositeForger([rpcForger, localForger]);
Tezos.setForgerProvider(composite);
```

### RpcForger

When the node is trusted, the forger can be set to an instance of `RpcForger` as follow:

```js
import { TezosToolkit, RpcForger } from '@taquito/taquito';

const Tezos = new TezosToolkit('https://YOUR_PREFERRED_RPC_URL');
Tezos.setForgerProvider(Tezos.getFactory(RpcForger)());
```
