Taquito allows developers to interact with Smart Contracts as if they are "Plain Old Javascript Objects".

The "Machine Language" of Tezos Smart Contracts is named [Michelson][3]. Michelson is a stack-based language that is human-readable. It's possible to author Smart-Contracts directly in Michelson. However, developers can use High-Level Languages (such as [Ligo][0] or [SmartPy][1]) to write smart contracts.

Taquito makes developing applications (dApps or traditional programs) around a Tezos Smart Contract easy. Taquito can also "originate" (create) a new Smart Contract to the Tezos Blockchain.

Michelson is a somewhat specialized language that isn't typical in Javascript or Typescript development contexts. Taquito helps to bridge the gap between the Tezos blockchain and a typical Javascript or Typescript development environment.

## Taquito's Smart Contract Abstraction

Taquito assists developers by reading the Michelson code for a given contract from the blockchain. Based on the retrieved Michelson code, Taquito generates a `contract` javascript object with methods and storage that correspond to the contract's Michelson entrypoints, storage definitions and values.

## The Counter Contract

In this guide, we use a straightforward "counter" smart contract to illustrate how Taquito works.

The counter contract has two entrypoints named `increment` and `decrement`. These entrypoints are used by Taquito to generate corresponding javascript methods that are available to the developer.

The counter contracts storage is a simple integer that gets increased or decreased based on the calls to the entrypoints.

### Counter Contract in CameLIGO

```ocaml
type storage = int

(* variant defining pseudo multi-entrypoint actions *)

type action =
| Increment of int
| Decrement of int

let add (a,b: int * int) : int = a + b
let sub (a,b: int * int) : int = a - b

(* real entrypoint that re-routes the flow based on the action provided *)

let main (p,s: action * storage) =
 let storage =
   match p with
   | Increment n -> add (s, n)
   | Decrement n -> sub (s, n)
 in ([] : operation list), storage

```

You can view this contract and deploy it to a testnet using the [Ligo WebIDE][2]

### Counter Contract Michelson source code

```
{ parameter (or (int %decrement) (int %increment)) ;
  storage int ;
  code { DUP ;
         CDR ;
         DIP { DUP } ;
         SWAP ;
         CAR ;
         IF_LEFT
           { DIP { DUP } ;
             SWAP ;
             DIP { DUP } ;
             PAIR ;
             DUP ;
             CAR ;
             DIP { DUP ; CDR } ;
             SUB ;
             DIP { DROP 2 } }
           { DIP { DUP } ;
             SWAP ;
             DIP { DUP } ;
             PAIR ;
             DUP ;
             CAR ;
             DIP { DUP ; CDR } ;
             ADD ;
             DIP { DROP 2 } } ;
         NIL operation ;
         PAIR ;
         DIP { DROP 2 } } }
```

## Loading the contract in Taquito

To load the contract from the Tezos Blockchain, we use the `Tezos.contract.at` method.
We can inspect the contract methods and data types using the `c.parameterSchema.ExtractSignatures()` method.

The following example shows how to load the contract, and view the methods on that contract.

```js live noInline
// const Tezos = new TezosToolkit('https://api.tez.ie/rpc/carthagenet');

Tezos.contract
  .at('KT1JVErLYTgtY8uGGZ4mso2npTSxqVLDRVbC')
  .then(c => {
    let methods = c.parameterSchema.ExtractSignatures();
    println(JSON.stringify(methods, null, 2));
  })
  .catch(error => console.log(`Error: ${error}`));
```

The `at()` method causes Taquito to query a Tezos nodes RPC API for the contracts "script" and "entrypoints". From these two inputs, Taquito builds an ordinary JavaScript object with methods that correspond to the Smart Contracts entrypoints.

The `at` method returns a representation of the contract as a plain old javascript object. Taquito dynamically creates an `increment` and `decrement` method that the developer can call as follows:

- `contract.methods.increment()`
- `contract.methods.decrement()`

In Tezos, to call an entrypoint on a contract, one must send a transfer operation. In the case of the counter contract, the transfer value can be `0` as the contract does not expect to receive any tokens. To call the `increment` entrypoint, the transfer must have the appropriate Michelson values specified as "params".

We can inspect the transfer params produced by Taquito using the `toTransferParams()` method as follows.

```js live noInline
// const Tezos = new TezosToolkit('https://api.tez.ie/rpc/carthagenet');

Tezos.contract
  .at('KT1JVErLYTgtY8uGGZ4mso2npTSxqVLDRVbC')
  .then(c => {
    let incrementParams = c.methods.increment(2).toTransferParams();
    println(JSON.stringify(incrementParams, null, 2));
  })
  .catch(error => console.log(`Error: ${error}`));
```

## Calling the Increment function

In the next example, we call the `send()` method. This example requires an additional ceremony for getting a temporary key for signing.

We call the `send()` method on the `increment()` method. Taquito then forges this operation into a transfer operation (with a transfer value of zero), signs the operation with our testing key, and injects or broadcast the operation to the Tezos RPC node.

Then we wait for the `confirmation(3)` to complete. The `3` number tells Taquito how many confirmations to wait for before resolving the promise. `3` is a good value for this type of demonstration, but we recommend a higher value if you are dealing with mainnet transactions.

```js live noInline
// const Tezos = new TezosToolkit('https://api.tez.ie/rpc/carthagenet');

Tezos.contract.at('KT1JVErLYTgtY8uGGZ4mso2npTSxqVLDRVbC')
  .then(contract => {
    const i = 7;

    println(`Incrementing storage value by ${i}...`);
    return contract.methods.increment(i).send();
  })
  .then(op => {
    println(`Awaiting for ${op.hash} to be confirmed...`);
    return op.confirmation(3).then(() => op.hash);
  })
  .then(hash => println(`Operation injected: https://carthagenet.tzstats.com/${hash}`))
  .catch(error => println(`Error: ${JSON.stringify(error, null, 2)}`));
```
