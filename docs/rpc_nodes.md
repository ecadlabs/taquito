## What to consider when choosing a node

- **Trust**: Choose a node that you can trust the people who operate it.
    - It should not alter your requests, for example, changing the operation data before forging it.
    - It should not censor your operations; you want to know that your operations will reach the network.
- **Reliability**: Consider your requirements for uptime, and choose your node option accordingly. If node availability is critical for your user-case,  consider self-hosting a node or contracting someone to operate a node specifically for you.
- ** End-points support**: Public nodes have different policies on the end-points that they expose. Your use case may require specific end-points to be available to your app. We have made a suite of [integration tests](rpc_nodes_integration_test.md) for the Taquito RPC package. These tests show what RPC end-points are available on a given node. These tests are available here: integration-tests/rpc-nodes.spec.ts.

## How to run a node

Running a node is a good way of contributing to Tezos by increasing the decentralization of the network.

There are many ways to set up a node. Here are some links providing general instructions:

- [Use docker images](https://tezos.gitlab.io/introduction/howtoget.html#docker-images)
- [Build from sources](https://tezos.gitlab.io/introduction/howtoget.html#docker-images)
- [Use Ansible Role](https://github.com/ecadlabs/ansible-role-tezos-node/blob/master/README.md)
