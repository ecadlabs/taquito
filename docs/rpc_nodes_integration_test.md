## Steps to run the tests

1. The RPC nodes' integration tests are disabled by default.
Remove `__tests__/rpc/nodes.spec.ts` from `"testPathIgnorePatterns"` in the package.json.

 **qenanet**: `npm run test:qenanet __tests__/rpc/nodes.spec.ts`

**When all endpoints are accessible for a node, you will obtain:**

```
