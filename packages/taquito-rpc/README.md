# Taquito RPC package
*Documentation can be found [here](https://tezostaquito.io/docs/rpc_package)*  
*TypeDoc style documentation is available on-line [here](https://tezostaquito.io/typedoc/modules/_taquito_rpc.html)*

`@taquito/rpc` is an npm package that provides low-level methods and types to invoke RPC calls from a Nomadic Tezos RPC node.

## General Information

The RPC package can be used to query the RPC API of your chosen node. Methods in the RPC package map one-to-one to the corresponding Tezos RPC API endpoints. All responses from the RPC are returns with TypeScript types.

The higher-level `@taquito/taquito` package builds on this RPC package.

## Install

```
npm i --save @taquito/rpc
```

## Usage
### RpcClient

The constructor of the `RpcClient` takes an RPC URL as a parameter and an optional chain (default is main).

```ts
import { RpcClient } from '@taquito/rpc';

const client = new RpcClient('https://YOUR_PREFERRED_RPC_URL');

// Fetching the balance of an account
const balance = await client.getBalance('tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb');
```

### RpcClientCache

The `RpcClientCache` class aims to improve the performance of dApps built using Taquito by reducing the number of calls made to the RPC. Its constructor takes a RpcClient instance as a parameter and an optional ttl (time to live). The RpcClient responses will be cached for the period defined by the ttl (default is of 1000 milliseconds). The `RpcClientCache` can be injected to the TezosToolkit as follow:

```ts
import { TezosToolkit } from '@taquito/taquito';
import { RpcClient, RpcClientCache } from '@taquito/rpc';

const rpcClient = new RpcClient('https://YOUR_PREFERRED_RPC_URL');
const tezos = new TezosToolkit(new RpcClientCache(rpcClient));
```
