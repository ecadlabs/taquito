# Timelock (BETA)

Timelock is a cryptographic primitive that can be used as a part of a commit & reveal scheme, it provides a guarantee that the information associated to the commit phase is eventually revealed.

## Commit & Reveal
A classic commit & reveal scheme consists of these 2 stepsL
- Before the deadline, each participant makes a decision and publishes a commitment, which is proof that they have made a decision that they are unable to change. The proof is the hash of the data they have decided on.
- After the deadline, each participant reveals the data corresponding to their commitment. Other participants will be able to check that the hash of this data is indeed the same as the previous commitment

This scheme makes it possible to prove a certain decision was made before the information is revealed. This information might be the decision of other participants, or some external independent information.

## Taquito Implementation

### Creating a chest
```
import { Chest } from '@taquito/timelock'

const time = 10000;
const payload = new TextEncoder().encode('message');
const { chest, key } = Chest.newChestAndKey(payload, time);

const chestBytes = chest.encode();
const keyBytes = key.encode();
```

### Create a chest from an existing Timelock
```
import { Chest, Timelock } from '@taquito/timelock';

// ...
const time = 10000;
const precomputedTimelock = Timelock.precompute(time); // can be cached
const  { chest, key } = Chest.fromTimelock(payload, time, precomputedTimelock);

const chestBytes = chest.encode();
const keyBytes = key.encode();
```

### Opening a chest
```
import { Chest, ChestKey} from '@taquito/timelock';

//...
const time = 10000;
const [chest] = Chest.fromArray(chestBytes);
const [chestKey] = ChestKey.fromArray(chestKeyBytes);
const data = chest.open(chestKey, time);

```

**Important Notes**:
- `time` param being passed should not be mistaken with the 'time' it takes for a chest to open in Timelocks. The `time` param here relates to a complexity relating to the number of power by modulo operations required to compute the key. Without getting too much into the weeds, we recommend using a value of `10000` and adjust accordingly.
- `payload` relates to the message payload you would like to lock in a chest
