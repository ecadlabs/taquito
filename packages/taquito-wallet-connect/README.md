_Documentation can be found [here](https://taquito.io/docs/walletconnect)_

## General Information

`@taquito/wallet-connect` is an npm package that provides developers a way to connect a dapp built with Taquito to a wallet giving the freedom to the users of the dapp to choose the wallet via the WalletConnect/Reown protocol. The `WalletConnect` class implements the `WalletProvider` interface, providing an alternative to `BeaconWallet`.
Note: Currently, a QR code is displayed to establish a connection with a wallet. As more Tezos wallets integrate with WalletConnect, we plan showing a list of available wallets alongside the QR code.

## Install

Install the package as follows

```
npm install @taquito/wallet-connect
```

## Usage

Create a wallet instance with defined option parameters and set the wallet provider using `setWalletProvider` to the `TezosToolkit` instance

```ts
import { TezosToolkit } from '@taquito/taquito';
import { WalletConnect } from '@taquito/wallet-connect';

const wallet = await WalletConnect.init({
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID", // can get YOUR_PROJECT_ID from [Reown Cloud](https://cloud.reown.com)
    metadata: {
        name: "Taquito Test Dapp",
        description: "Test Taquito with WalletConnect",
        icons: [],
        url: "",
    },
});

await wallet.requestPermissions({
    permissionScope: {
        networks: [NetworkType.GHOSTNET],
        events: [],
        methods: [
            PermissionScopeMethods.TEZOS_SEND,
            PermissionScopeMethods.TEZOS_SIGN,
            PermissionScopeMethods.TEZOS_GET_ACCOUNTS
        ],
    }
});

const Tezos = new TezosToolkit('https://YOUR_PREFERRED_RPC_URL');
Tezos.setWalletProvider(wallet);
```
