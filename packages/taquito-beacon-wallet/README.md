_TypeDoc style documentation is available [here](https://tezostaquito.io/typedoc/modules/_taquito_beacon_wallet.html)_

## General Information

`@taquito/taquito-beacon-wallet` is an npm package implementing the TZIP-10 standard that describes the communication between decentralized applications and wallets. The package provides developers a way to connect a dapp built with Taquito to a wallet giving the freedom to the users of the dapp to choose the wallet they want.

## Install

Install the package as follows

```
npm install @taquito/beacon-wallet
```

## Usage

Create a wallet instance with defined option parameters and set the wallet provider using `setWalletProvider` to the `TezosToolkit` instance

```ts
import { TezosToolkit } from '@taquito/taquito';
import { BeaconWallet } from '@taquito/beacon-wallet';

const options = {
  name: 'MyAwesomeDapp',
  iconUrl: 'https://tezostaquito.io/img/favicon.svg',
  preferredNetwork: 'chosen_network',
  eventHandlers: {
    PERMISSION_REQUEST_SUCCESS: {
      handler: async (data) => {
        console.log('permission data:', data);
      },
    },
  },
};
const wallet = new BeaconWallet(options);

// The Beacon wallet requires an extra step to set up the network to connect to and the permissions:
await wallet.requestPermissions({
  network: {
    type: 'chosen_network',
  },
});

const Tezos = new TezosToolkit('https://YOUR_PREFERRED_RPC_URL');
Tezos.setWalletProvider(wallet);
```
