## Usage

Create a wallet instance with defined option parameters and set the wallet provider using `setWalletProvider` to the `TezosToolkit` instance

```ts
import { TezosToolkit } from '@taquito/taquito';
import { BeaconWallet } from '@taquito/beacon-wallet';

const options = {
  name: 'MyAwesomeDapp',
  iconUrl: 'https://taquito.io/img/favicon.svg',
  network: { type: 'ghostnet' },
  enableMetrics: true,
};
const wallet = new BeaconWallet(options);

await wallet.requestPermissions();

await wallet.client.subscribeToEvent(
  BeaconEvent.ACTIVE_ACCOUNT_SET,
  async (account) => {
    // An active account has been set, update the dApp UI
    console.log(`${BeaconEvent.ACTIVE_ACCOUNT_SET} triggered: `, account);
  },
);

const Tezos = new TezosToolkit('https://YOUR_PREFERRED_RPC_URL');
Tezos.setWalletProvider(wallet);
