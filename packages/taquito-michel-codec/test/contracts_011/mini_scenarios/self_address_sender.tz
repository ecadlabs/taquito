# This tests that the SELF_ADDRESS inside a lambda returns the address
# of the contract executing the lambda (not the contract defining it).
# To do so, two contracts called the sender and the receiver are used.
# The sender (this contract) sends the lambda { DROP; SELF_ADDRESS }
# to the receiver (see self_address_receiver.tz) who checks that the
# returned value is the same as its SELF_ADDRESS.
