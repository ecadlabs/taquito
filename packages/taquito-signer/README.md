# Taquito Signer package
*Documentation can be found [here](https://tezostaquito.io/docs/inmemory_signer)*  
*TypeDoc style documentation is available on-line [here](https://tezostaquito.io/typedoc/modules/_taquito_signer.html)*

`@taquito/signer` is an npm package that provides developers with signing functionality for Taquito.

## General Information

The Inmemory signer is a local signer implementation that allows you to directly use a private key in your browser or your nodejs app. When the InMemorySigner is configured, all Taquito functionalities that need signing support can be used. The operation will be signed automatically using the signer (no prompt).

This signer implementation is for development workflows.

**Storing private keys in memory is suitable for development workflows but risky for
production use-cases! Use the InMemorySigner appropriately given your risk profile.**

## Install 
```
npm i --save @taquito/taquito
npm i --save @taquito/signer
```

## Usage
### Loading an unencrypted private key

```js
import { InMemorySigner } from '@taquito/signer';
import { TezosToolkit } from '@taquito/taquito';

const Tezos = new TezosToolkit('https://YOUR_PREFERRED_RPC_URL');

Tezos.setProvider({ signer: await InMemorySigner.fromSecretKey('edsk...') });
```

### Loading an encrypted private key with a passphrase

If your private key is encrypted, you can specify a passphrase to decrypt it. Doing so will automatically decrypt the key and allow you to use the signer to sign transactions.

```js
import { InMemorySigner } from '@taquito/signer';
import { TezosToolkit } from '@taquito/taquito';

const Tezos = new TezosToolkit('https://YOUR_PREFERRED_RPC_URL');
Tezos.setProvider({
  signer: await InMemorySigner.fromSecretKey('your_private_key', 'your_passphrase'),
});
```
