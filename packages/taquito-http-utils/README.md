# Taquito HTTP Utilities package
*TypeDoc style documentation is available [here](https://tezostaquito.io/typedoc/modules/_taquito_http_utils.html)*

`@taquito/http-utils` is an npm package that provides developers with http functionality for Taquito.

## General Information

The `HttpBackend` class contains a `createRequest` method which accepts options to be passed for the HTTP request (url, method, timeout, json, query, headers, mimeType). This method will help users interact with the RPC with a more familiar HTTP format.

Parameters for `createRequest`:

`url`(string): RPC URL pointing to the Tezos node 
`method`(string): HTTP method of the request
`timeout`(number): request timeout 
`json`(boolean): Parse response into JSON when set to `true`; defaults to `true`
`query`(object): Query that we would like to pass as an HTTP request
`headers`(object): HTTP request header 
`mimeType`(string): Sets the MIME type of the request; see [MIME types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types)


## Install
The package(s) need to be installed as follows
```
npm install @taquito/http-utils
```

## Usage
Create an instance of `HttpBackend` and call it's member function `createRequest` to construct an HTTP request. 
```ts
import { HttpBackend } from '@taquito/http-utils';

const httpBackend = new HttpBackend();
const response = httpBackend.createRequest<string>({
    url: `/chains/${chain}/blocks/${block}/context/contracts/${address}/script`,
    method: 'GET',
    mimeType: "text; charset=utf-8",
    json: false
});

```
