# Taquito Remote Signer package
*TypeDoc style documentation is available on-line [here](https://tezostaquito.io/typedoc/modules/_taquito_remote_signer.html)*

`@taquito/remote-signer` is an npm package that provides developers with remote signing functionality for Taquito. 

## General Information

If you require the server-side signing of operations on the mainnet, we recommend exploring the use of the Remote Signer package in conjunction with an HSM remote signer such as [Signatory](https://signatory.io/) or [TacoInfra's Remote Signer](https://github.com/tacoinfra/remote-signer).

## Install 

```
npm i --save @taquito/taquito
npm i --save @taquito/remote-signer
```

## Usage

When the `RemoteSigner` is configured on the `TezosToolkit`, Taquito features that require signing support can be used. The Contract API operations will be signed using the signer. Validation of the signature will be conducted before the operation is injected. The `RemoteSigner` can be injected into the `TezosToolkit` as follows:

```ts
import { TezosToolkit } from '@taquito/taquito';
import { RemoteSigner } from '@taquito/remote-signer';

const Tezos = new TezosToolkit('https://YOUR_PREFERRED_RPC_URL');
const signer = new RemoteSigner(pkh, rootUrl);
Tezos.setSignerProvider(signer);

// Taquito will send a request to the configured Remote Signer to sign the transfer operation:
await Tezos.contract.transfer({ to: publicKeyHash, amount: 2 });
```

The constructor of the `RemoteSigner` class requires the public key hash and the URL of the remote signer as parameters. It also takes optional headers (i.e., Authorization) and an optional `HttpBackend` to override the default one if needed.

### Authenticated requests
`RemoteSigner` can use an authenticated protocol. All you need is to pass a secret key in the Tezos Base58 format as `RemoteSignerOptions` property:

```ts
const authSecretKey = 'edsk39CjLvKZhJ1NEaCTE6A1cgHjt5mK2mFdCqqMr1P54qLnwmiCAr';
// ...
const signer = new RemoteSigner(pkh, rootUrl, { authSecretKey });
// next steps as above
```
