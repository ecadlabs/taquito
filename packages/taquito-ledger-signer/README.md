# Taquito Ledger Signer package
*Documentation can be found [here](https://taquito.io/docs/ledger_signer)*  
*TypeDoc style documentation is available [here](https://taquito.io/typedoc/modules/_taquito_ledger_signer.html)*

## General Information
`@taquito/ledger-signer` is an npm package that provides developers with ledger signing functionality for Taquito. It implements the Signer interface of Taquito, allowing you to sign operations from a Ledger Nano device.

## Install
Install the package as follows
```
npm install @taquito/ledger-signer
```

## Usage
### Prerequisites
To use the Ledger Signer we must first import the desired transport from the [LedgerJs library](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledgerjs).

The Ledger Signer has currently been tested with `@ledgerhq/hw-transport-node-hid` for Node-based applications and with `@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webhid` for web applications.

Pass an instance of the transport of your choice to the Ledger Signer as follows:
```ts
import transportWeb from '@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webhid';
import { LedgerSigner } from '@taquito/ledger-signer';

const transport = await transportWeb.create();
const ledgerSigner = new LedgerSigner(transport);
```

The constructor of the `LedgerSigner` class takes three other optional parameters. If none are specified, the following default values are used:

- `path`: **default value is "44'/1729'/0'/0'"**  
  You can use as a parameter the `HDPathTemplate` which refers to `44'/1729'/${account}'/0'`. You have to specify the index of the account you want to use. Or you can also use a complete path as a parameter. More details about paths [here](https://taquito.io/docs/ledger_signer#derivation-paths-hd-wallet--bip-standards)
- `prompt`: **default is true**  
  If true, you will be asked on your Ledger device to send your public key for validation. **_Note that confirmation is required when using `@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webhid`, so you should not set this parameter to false if you are using this transport._**
- `derivationType`: **default is DerivationType.ED25519**  
  It can be DerivationType.ED25519 | DerivationType.BIP32_ED25519 (tz1), DerivationType.SECP256K1 (tz2) or DerivationType.P256 (tz3).

```ts
import { LedgerSigner, DerivationType, HDPathTemplate } from '@taquito/ledger-signer';

const ledgerSigner = new LedgerSigner(
  transport, //required
  HDPathTemplate(1), // path optional (equivalent to "44'/1729'/1'/0'")
  true, // prompt optional
  DerivationType.ED25519 // derivationType optional
);
```

### Code Example

```ts
import { LedgerSigner } from '@taquito/ledger-signer';
import TransportWeb from '@ledgerhq/hw-transport-webhid';
import { TezosToolkit } from '@taquito/taquito';

const Tezos = new TezosToolkit('https://YOUR_PREFERRED_RPC_URL');

const transport = await TransportWeb.create();
const ledgerSigner = new LedgerSigner(transport);

Tezos.setProvider({ signer: ledgerSigner });

//Get the public key and the public key hash from the Ledger
const publicKey = await Tezos.signer.publicKey();
const publicKeyHash = await Tezos.signer.publicKeyHash();
```
