# Taquito Integration Tests

The `integration-tests` directory contains a testing suite for various contract interactions that require querying a live chain to test properly.

## How to test

If you feel obliged, you can run the entire test suite with `npm run test` inside the `integration-tests` directory. Do know that this can take a bit of time to fully run. 

If you'd like to take a more targeted approach you can use the command: `npm run test -- -t "Title of test here"` So if I have a test block that starts with `it('does some stuff)` then the command `npm run test -- -t "does some stuff"` will run this test only and save you loads of time.
